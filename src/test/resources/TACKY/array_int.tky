    // NOTE: there is no information about the amount of elements stored in this array!
    // Q: How does the tacky runtime know, that the next variable needs to be placed so far away
    // that there is enough space for all the arrays elements?
    //
    // A: The memory module has already processed the array size and has allocated enough memory for the array
    //
    // Q: What if I want to execute a tacky file and I have no access to the result of the memory module's layout?
    //
    // A: OPTION 1: Then arrays are always spilled (not placed into registers any more but into memory)
    //    The implementation inside the tacky vm then needs to be a list of elements somehow!?!?
    //    Then executing assembly code and executing the TACKY on the TACKY vm will show different behaviour!
    //
    // A: OPTION 2: Force the user to encode the length of the array into the TACKY code. For example if there
    //    is an array of six elements, define six int variables in TACKY code in a consecutive manner!
    //    Then the array will point to the first of these six int variables. And the assumption has to hold which
    //    says that consecutively defined scalar values are also managed in a consecutive manner by the TACKY VM,
    //    in order to make pointer arithmetic work. a ptr++ then just jumps to the next integer just like A
    //    real array is implemented in assembly.
