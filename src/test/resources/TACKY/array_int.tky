    // NOTE: there is no information about the amount of elements stored in this array!
    // Q: How does the tacky runtime know, that the next variable needs to be placed so far away
    // that there is enough space for all the arrays elements?
    //
    // A: The memory module has already processed the array size and has allocated enough 
    //    memory for the array
    //
    // Q: What if I want to execute a tacky file and I have no access to the result of the 
    //    memory module's layout?
    //
    // A: OPTION 1: Then arrays are always spilled (not placed into registers any more but into memory)
    //    The implementation inside the tacky VM then needs to be a list of elements somehow!?!?
    //    Then executing assembly code and executing the TACKY on the TACKY VM will show different 
    //    behaviour!
    //
    // A: OPTION 2: Force the user to encode the length of the array into the TACKY code. For example 
    //    if there is an array of six elements, define six int variables in TACKY code in a consecutive
    //    manner! Then the array will point to the first of these six int variables. And the assumption 
    //    has to hold which says that consecutively defined scalar values are also managed in a 
    //    consecutive manner by the TACKY VM, in order to make pointer arithmetic work. a ptr++ then 
    //    just jumps to the next integer just like a real array is implemented in assembly.
    //    This means when the TACKY VM sees several consecutive variables with the same prefix
    //    and differing only by a digit following the prefix,
    //    the TACKY VM spills them into memory automatically to treat them as an array.

    // If the TACKY VM does not get type information from the lexical analysis stage, it does not know
    // what types the variables are because there are no types in the TACKY grammar!

    // To force the creation of an array in TACKY VM without type information from lexical analysis 
    // stage, use the special naming convention <ARRAY_NAME>_array_element_<IDX>, where <ARRAY_NAME> 
    // is the common identifier for all elements of that array and <IDX> is the index of the element.

    // TACKY VM will automatically:
    // 1. spill all elements into memeory so that they do have an address and pointer arithmetic
    //    works on them
    // 2. place them in a packed, consecutive fashion into memory so that again, pointer arithmetic
    //    works on the array

    // create the array "test" with four int32_t elements
    //
    // without variable definition table from semantic analysis stage, 
    // the TACKY VM assumes a single int32_t variable in a register
    //
